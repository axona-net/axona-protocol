// regionRoles.js — A ROLE GOES ONLY TO A NODE IN THE TOPIC'S REGION.
//
// David, 2026-11-13: "A topic role can only be assigned to a node that shares
// the region of that topic." Message sending is NOT affected: routing uses the
// best route whatever the region. A region with too few nodes may fail, and its
// history may be lost; the app is told no nodes were found in the region and
// may switch regions. The bridge region is not excluded outright: the rule is
// region EQUALITY and nothing more, so a bridge holds no role for an ordinary
// topic and may hold one for a topic minted in the bridge region.
//
// Design and the three council reads: axona-docs design/same-region-role-rule.md
// (c07a204). This REVERSES invariant I-16 for roles and keeps it for routing.
//
// DEFAULT OFF (option regionRoles; null = env REGION_ROLES). Unarmed, every
// method here answers as 4.137.0 did and nothing in the kernel compares regions.
//
// THE SHAPE (Orion ef78e8c7, Aster cd1da075):
//   · Routing is untouched. Greedy and the two-hop lookahead use every peer.
//   · The test is on SELF wherever a node takes a role itself: root birth,
//     promotion, the reachable-root claim, the self retry of a write, and the
//     receiver's commit of ADOPT, REPLICATE, HANDOFF and a staged handover.
//   · The test is on the LIST wherever a node picks another: backup cohort,
//     heir, write-retry target, verify nominee, child relay.
//   · A node outside the region that is the walk's end STOPS the walk. It does
//     not root, and it does not climb by the incapable-leaf fallback (that
//     path, reused on relays, walks uphill to MAX_HOPS). The handler returns
//     NOT consumed, so the sender's retry or renewal carries the message.
//   · A foreign root's beacon is still EVIDENCE (epoch, the merge trigger). It
//     is only never deferred to and never yielded to.
//   · It is NOT in the "am I alone?" guard, which has no topic and measures
//     reach: foreign peers are the route into the region.
//   · Reads are never filtered: an old holder outside the region stays
//     pullable until its history has been transferred.
